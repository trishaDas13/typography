The HTML <img> tag is utilized for embedding images within web pages. Serving as a self-closing element, it lacks an explicit closing tag. An integral attribute, src (source) is employed to determine the image file's URL or relative path, dictating the image to be displayed. This tag is crucial for rendering images, while the optional alt attribute provides descriptive text for accessibility or when images fail to load. It's imperative to ensure accurate URLs or paths within the src attribute for proper image rendering.

The "p" tag in HTML is employed to create paragraphs, organizing and formatting textual content on web pages. It adds spacing above and below the enclosed text for improved readability.

The "div" tag in HTML functions as a versatile container, allowing grouping of content elements for styling and layout purposes. It aids in structuring and organizing components within web pages. Its attributes can be utilized with CSS and JavaScript for enhanced design and interactivity.

The "iframe" tag in HTML enables seamless embedding of external web content within a page, maintaining the surrounding context. It's commonly used for integrating maps, videos, or other interactive elements. The tag's attributes control dimensions, source, and other settings for the embedded content.

width: 25rem;: This property sets the width of an element to 25 "rem" units, which are relative to the root font size. It's a responsive way to define the width.

color: rgba(105, 104, 104, 0.9);: This property specifies the text color using an RGBA value, where the first three numbers represent the red, green, and blue components, and the fourth number (0.9) represents the alpha (transparency) level.

font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;: This property sets the preferred font family for the text, specifying a list of fonts in order of preference. If the browser doesn't have the first font, it tries the next one, and so on, until it finds a suitable font.

display: block;: This property defines how an element is displayed. In this case, it sets the element to a block-level display, which means it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.

margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;: These properties center-align the element horizontally by setting equal margins on the left and right sides. The use of "auto" for margins pushes the element to the center within its containing element.

font-weight: lighter;: This property adjusts the font weight of the text. In this case, it makes the text lighter in weight compared to the default font weight.
